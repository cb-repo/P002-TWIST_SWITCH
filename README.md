The TWIST SWITCH is a rugged manual power cutoff for combat robotics and other high-power applications.

Designed to safely and reliably connect or disconnect power with a simple twist. 

The switch uses a bolt to physically bridge power pads, forming a solid low-resistance connection that wonâ€™t shake loose under impact

Large solder pads are present on the top and bottom allowing multiple nets to be easily soldered to the switched output.

Designed and built in [Christchurch, New Zealand ](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Christchurch+New+Zealand) by Connor Benton.
